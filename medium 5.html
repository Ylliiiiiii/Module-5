    1. Start with a new HTML file 
    and set up the basic structure.  
2. Create a <header> element 
    and include a heading that says "Travel Bucket List."  
3. Inside the header, add 
 navigation menu with two links: "Home" and "Destinations."  
4. Create a <main> element 
    and divide it into two sections.  
5. In the first section, create 
an ordered list of your top five dream travel destinations.  
6. In the second section, create 
 unordered list of essential items to pack for a trip.  
7. Add at least five items 
to each list, ensuring they are properly indented and organized.
